excerpt: 'Here, we focus on the chromatin landscape and paired gene expression across the developing human brain to provide a comprehensive single cell atlas during the first trimester (6 - 13 post-conceptional weeks). We identified 135 clusters across half a million cells and using the multiomic measurements linked candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) to gene expression. We found an increase in the number of accessible regions driven both by age and neuronal differentiation. Using a convolutional neural network we identified putative functional TF-binding sites in enhancers characterizing neuronal subtypes and we applied this model to cCREs upstream of ESRRB to elucidate its activation mechanism. Finally, by linking disease-associated SNPs to cCREs we validated putative pathogenic mechanisms in several diseases and identified midbrain-derived GABAergic neurons as being the most vulnerable to major depressive disorder related mutations. Together, our findings provide a higher degree of detail to some key gene regulatory mechanisms underlying the emergence of cell types during the first trimester. We anticipate this resource to be a valuable reference for future studies related to human neurodevelopment, such as identifying cell type specific enhancers that can be used for highly specific targeting in in vitro models.'
