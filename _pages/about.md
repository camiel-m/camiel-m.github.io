Hello there! 

My name is Camiel Mannens, I'm originally from the Netherlands, where I grew up in a province that's 99% made up of <u><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flevoland'>land reclaimed from the sea</a></u>. I have been fascinated by (epi-) genetics ever since I learned about what that term mean. Add to that a love for the human brain, data and maps and it seems inevitable I would at some point want to work in the single cell field.

At the moment I am a PhD student in the lab of <u><a href='https://linnarssonlab.org'>Sten Linnarsson</a></u> at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden. Before this I completed my Bachelor's education (BSc Psychobiology and BSc Biomedical Sciences) and  Master's education  (MSc Biomedical Sciences - Molecular Neuroscience) at the University of Amsterdam in 2016 and 2018 respectively.

Research focus
======
My primary focus is to apply high-throughput sequencing methodologies to complex biological systems and to develop the computational tools and pipelines required to analyze such data. In particular I am interested in gene regulation and how it is organized in healthy systems and how it can be disorganized in disease.

In addition to this I am also interested in the spatial organization of human development. We have previously designed a novel probe based spatial transcriptomic technique called EEL smFISH to query expression in large tissue sections and I also work with live-imaging for which I built a perfusion system to our specific needs.

Research experience
======
During my bachelor's intership I worked with Dr. H.J. van Heesbeen in the <u><a href='https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/s/m/m.p.smidt/m.p.smidt.html'>Prof. Dr. Smidt lab</a></u> to understand how the DOT1L co-factor AF1 could impact cortical development in mice. This then  prompted me to  join their Masters program. I later joined the group of <u><a href='https://ctg.cncr.nl'>Prof. Dr. Posthuma</a></u> where I worked with Dr. Erdogan Taskesen to bring together publicly available GWAS data, protein-protein interaction data and some early scRNA-seq data from the human cortex to predict druggable targets in Alzheimer's disease. This got me very excited about the possibilities of single-cell sequencing and the wonderful world of bio-informatics. I then moved to Stockholm to join the Linnarsson lab for my Master's thesis to work with Dr. Lars Borm and Dr. Simone Codeluppi, where we developed the prototype of what would later become the EEL smFISH methodology. After my thesis I stayed in the Linnarsson lab to do my PhD.
