In 2020 10X Genomics invited me to give a talk about our ongoing efforts to generate a comprehensive atlas of all cell types in the developing human brain. I had recently started to collect scATAC-seq and single cell paired ATAC:RNA-seq using the 10X chromium platform and presented some of our preliminary findings. <u><a href="https://www.10xgenomics.com/videos/plud48w3nn?autoplay=true">The webinar can be seen in its entirety here</a>.</u>
